## Changelog

## Version 0.4.1

Date: Unreleased

- Make `DataSource#name` mandatory to implement
- Add `fetch-debug` project with debugging facilities for Fetch

## Version 0.4.0

Date: 2016-11-14

- Added support for Scala 2.12.0
- Updated cats to 0.8.1 (and monix to the compatible 2.1.0).
- Support a maximum batch size per `DataSource` (https://github.com/47deg/fetch/pull/76).
- Provided a new implementation for Parallel joins. This new impl changes the way fetches are inspected to parallelize independent fetches. It does this by adding a new Join construct to the Fetch structure. This Join is parallelized in a new intermediate interpreter which inspects the actual Free constructs and replaces cached fetches by Free.Pure.
- Updated the scalafmt version which triggered some code reformatting. There is apparently an issue with sbt and scalafmt (sbt/sbt#2786) which keeps us from using sbt 0.13.13.
